# We use global GRAPH interface.
#
# 1) NODE is a NODE only if it has a Makefile. It will be NODE's root path.
# 2) NODE may have `dist` directory (means directory may be deployed to somewhere and ONLY content of this directory might be deployed).
# 3) Each NODE's Makefile must implement at least targets below:
# - lint
# - test
# - publish
#
# Current Makefile is just proxy part and entrypoint for GRAPH as a NODE.
# Means also implements interface described above.
#
# The only variables required for working is:
# 1) Root of the GRAPH (current path).
# 2) NODE's path (path to directory containing NODE's Makefile)
# 3) NODE's basename. Used for naming convetion and dist naming.
#
# NODE variable defined from somewhere (cli options, env variables, etc) means
# that we work with concrete NODE, just proxy targets to their Makefile.
# Otherwise we work with GRAPH as a NODE. This means, we must get the list of NODES
# and proxy targets to each og them.


# Define root of the graph immediately.
ROOT := $(CURDIR)


# Define base function to render NODE's target recipe.
# This recipe is proxy that just invoke same make from the NODE's root directory.
# NOTE: function have 'lazy' definition (recalculates each time).
# NOTE: because it is recipe template each line (including last empty line) is very important!
